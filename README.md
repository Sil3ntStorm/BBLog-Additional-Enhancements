## BBLog-Additional-Enhancements 
###### Previously knows as: ~~BBLog-Remove-Buy-BattlePacks~~

BBLog Plugin for removing and hiding various elements in BattleFields 4's BattleLog. This plugin only supports Battlefield 4 (BF4).

As of right now there are 3 options:  
1 - Removes the 'BUY BATTLEPACKS' box above the 'UPCOMING RANK BATTLEPACKS' box in the Battlepacks page.  
2 - Removes the tiles below the 'TOP STORY' in the landing page (battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/).  
3 - Removes the right sidebar in the landing page (battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/) and expands the battle feed.
